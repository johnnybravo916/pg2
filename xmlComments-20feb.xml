    <content><![CDATA[ You have announced at the last DBS OPEN that GOOD access is now available to all staff. I think this is a great idea, especially for people like us who are always on the move and who had to stay back in office to clear emails. With O365, it will improve our efficiency tremendously. Thumbs up!

  However, how can we address mobile data usage while using GOOD? 1Bankroam Wi-Fi within the office compound has been disabled with the reason that corporate lines are bundled with free data plans. We all know that corporate lines do not apply to AVPs and below. By having GOOD, usage within the office compound or out on the move may still not seem to be very ideal. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ The 1bankroam staff WI-FI has been abruptly terminated this September. It was stated in the Collaborative User Services intranet site that Starhub corporate lines have free data plans (I assume this is staff CIS plans) but I've checked with Starhub and there are no such free data plans.  This is the relevant section from the site.
    'As current Starhub corporate lines are bundled with free data plans, with effect from 16 September 2016, 1bankroam Wi-Fi service will be discontinued.'
Can the 1bankroam WI-FI be restored?  For staff using the Good Work app on personal smartphones, it is consuming a large amount of data at our own expense.  Please consider bringing 1bankroam back to DBS premises. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ Lately, there has been a surge of emails asking staff to download apps such as DBS E-Learning, CBO Rewards, Good Work, Good Access, to name a few.  It's good that the bank is targeting Digital Banking. It should focus on customers instead of staff.  A handphone is a personal item and there is limited data, depending on the data plan. Free Wi-Fi has been disabled and who will pay if data usage is exceeded?  With all these apps, will work-life balance be affected? ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ I believe that the crowding of the lift lobby at DBS Asia Hub (DAH) has been highlighted many times before.  Normally, the lifts are programmed such that once the button has been pressed, one lift will respond while the other lifts will be on standby if not occupied.  However, during morning peak hours, we all know that one lift at a time is not enough. Thus, the default programming above is not effective, especially when the lifts on standby are usually at higher levels. People would usually see a full lift go up and wait for an empty one to come down from level nine.  Will it be possible for the default standby level for all lifts to be at level one, i.e. all vacant lifts will automatically go back to level one and have their doors open on standby to cater to the morning crowd?  The opposite can be applied in the evening. ]]></content>

The situation seems to have gotten unwieldy now as there are stickers at social hub benches and tables at The Exchange in every direction. The wooden tables are now showing signs of wear when the decals are removed, as the varnish is affected by the adhesive. Is there a specific owner policing what stickers go up, how they are positioned and ensure furniture is touched up if there is damage? ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ It is nice to have an exclusive kitchen for the staff on level 13.  However, I would like to suggest that people stop 'chope-ing the seats with a tissue pack'. I reserve my opinion on this Singapore culture that is otherwise practised in a food court, but the whole point of having our own canteen is for us to have a quick and easy lunch. The queues are typically long and people need at least 10 minutes to complete their order, that is enough time for many people to finish their meal. Having the table reserved but not used while waiting defeats the purpose of having a staff canteen. It reduces the turnover tremendously and it is not good manners to fellow colleagues when half of the seats are empty but 'reserved'. ]]></content>

This will be a good place for our Muslim and Christian friends to pray, but also for everyone to have a quiet area where they can reflect if the need arises. It will be good for cohesion - meant for everyone. When our Indonesian colleagues come over, it is also difficult for them to find a place to pray in our Singapore buildings. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ I want to share my experience in my previous company in the Philippines where the huddle rooms are transformed into themed rooms decorated with the appropriate wallpaper and furniture / accessories e.g. Rejuvenation Room (spa with a massage chair), Library (with books for sharing and a lazy boy), Boracay (beach wallpaper and beach chairs), Tennis Room (big soft tennis ball as a chair and a customised big shuttle cock lighting), Dance Room (with three walls of mirrors), Music Room (with musical equipment like a band), Forest Room (wallpaper of trees), Car Room (with racing car sets and TV, set up like an arcade), etc. We also had foosball tables in every pantry, a boxing room and a mini gym where exercise classes are conducted (similar to our 13F classes). It was so cool that it was featured in one of the local magazines and the company is regarded as one of the best employers in the country. 

  The rooms can be used through a booking system so that staff have the chance to use different themes. I think DBS employees will love it. For a start, aside from the foosball tables, we can transform one focus room or meeting room per floor or per department, into a themed room. Each floor / department can nominate the theme they want to install (within an approved budget (?), can top up(?)) and engage employees in the process. I think this will transform the view of going to meetings into a more exciting activity. We can be featured by office interior design magazines which will in turn attract talent to join our company (provided we have vacancies because I believe it's hard for people to leave such a cool company!). I also think that it will help us make working in DBS even more Joyful. It is like work-life balance is already brought into the office.

  PS: I have been with DBS for four years now, two years and eight months as an external contractor, left to join another bank but came back after two months, one year and four months as a perm staff. Working with DBS makes me feel at home which is why I came back. And I hope to decorate my 'home' into a more joyful place. I'm thankful for this experience and I'm proud to be part of a great company. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ A few weeks ago, I had to do an early tech refresh as my Lenovo laptop's wireless card was faulty and was not longer under warranty. This inconvenienced me because I could not move from one location to another without having to restart my machine to get connected to the office network. Sometimes I had to restart my machine several times. I ordered the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, which was recently made available. My new machine was delivered in October and the set-up was only done some three weeks later in November.

  I tried time and again to request for the machine delivery and the set-up to coincide with each other, but I was informed that this was not possible as there were insufficient engineers to do the set-up. It did not make any sense for me to receive a new machine, only to have the new machine set-up three weeks later. In addition, I was also informed that I had to request for data transfer to be done, for which there would be additional charges. I wonder if the product bundle on EPS for tech refresh should include data transfer services (as opposed to that of request for new machines)?  How might we improve the employee experience for the staff who needs to get a new machine to do his / her job effectively? ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ Thanks for giving us the opportunity to share with you.
  This is regarding the Internet Banking and Mobile Banking Mainframe as well as deployment for different systems on Saturdays and Sundays.  We have noticed in the past two years that every release is deployed over the weekend. Could you please change it to working days?  Advantages of shifting it to working days:

  - All relevant parties (Technical, Management for approvals), besides just the planned support team will be available during deployment.  So if any issues arise, the resolution and approvals will be quick.

  - Minimal work required to do support roster or we can avoid preparation of support roster altogether

  - As I understand, weekends are no different from working days and even more business happens.

  - Team DBS can spend quality time with family and give more effort towards the DBS projects.

  - This way, we can improve the ‘relationship-led’ in our PRIDE! values. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ I've been working in DBS for 19 years but why does DBS pay little attention to employees’ salaries, especially those who have been working in the bank for a long time?  As we know, DBS is the biggest bank in Asia and it should pay attention to the welfare of staff. For example, my salary is only IDR 5,600,000.  After deductions for loan and tax of IDR 1,400,000, can you imagine how much I take home?  Mr Piyush, need your advice." commentnumber="3" tags="HR" answer="It is not correct to say that we don’t look at these things. In fact, our process for benchmarking salaries is actually very robust. First, we look at market comparisons and you have to understand that there is a market price for every job. We do market comparisons to understand the market price for the job and we are quite comfortable that the market levels are right.  We make sure that we benchmark against the right set of people who we want to compare with. 

In deciding salary matters, there are many factors to consider. These include performance record, past experiences, skill-set, one’s potential and market conditions. We also make sure that we review for internal equity.

Basically, the way to get a salary increase is to be able to move into bigger roles. Talk to your HR Business partner or supervisor about possible moves and job advancements to where the market compensates more. ]]></content>

    <answer>Providing for TCM under company medical benefits is still not a market norm in Singapore today. We have taken a forward looking approach and gone above the market practice by covering TCM for up to 5 visits a year, as our insurer is prepared to cap the number of visits to 5 per year without significantly increasing our premium. You also have the option to use your iFlex$ for TCM claims, as well as other alternative medical practices e.g. Chiropractic.</answer>

It was a surprise to me that this wasn’t the case in DBS. Although the self-borne amount to add dependents to the plan is not a big sum, it's about how we think DBS cares about us.  I guess there may be reasons like how additional coverage may not be fair to those staff without dependents.

    <answer><![CDATA[ First, we do have an active policy encouraging flexi-work arrangements and one of the things that we have done in the last couple of years is encourage HR to communicate and make sure people understand what the policy is – flexible work hours, working part-time etc.

Second, we realised that even though the policy exists, the inability to access systems can be an impediment. You should recognise that as a bank, we need to balance between a much higher level of security with remote access. However, within that constraint, we are now reviewing and giving more and more access to employees. Last year we gave all permanent employees the option to have ‘Good Work’ (now renamed as BlackBerry Work). This is an example of a bold step in that direction. As we make more changes, more can access from home.

Third, there will be some systems that will still be difficult to access. But I have asked individual BUSUs to explore with FCSS what systems they are and what systems they are more open to externalising. Over time, we are also looking at moving to cloud, as we do that, it should make it easier for more people to get remote access to the systems.

Fourth, having said all that, I do think there is some value for people to interact and have face time. And in that regard, working together and interacting creates a much higher level of productivity, we do need to get the balance right. I think creating interactions, working together and working in teams is as important to create innovation and productivity. ]]></answer>

    <content><![CDATA[ Many companies have embarked on flexi-work arrangements and allowing employees to work from home when work permits.  However, the face-time culture is still extremely strong in DBS. Most managers do not allow working from home and even expect employees to ‘show’ that they work long hours as a benchmark of how hardworking they are.  This discourages efficiency and is counterproductive. I hope to see a change of tone from the top and for the bank to formally allow working from home once a week or in some way or another. ]]></content>

Why is it that our managers have such thoughts instead of thinking that employees are efficient? They make us record our every single deal / task done in this MKT / Dwor, but it is very time consuming and not efficient at all. Most of the time, people do not reflect a true figure. We already have enough BAU and non-BAU work to cover but seems like it’s never enough from the managers' view.

Over time, we are also looking at moving to cloud, as we do that, it should make it easier for more people to get remote access to the systems.

Fourth, having said all that, I do think there is some value for people to interact and have face time. And in that regard, working together and interacting creates a much higher level of productivity, we do need to get the balance right. I think creating interactions, working together and working in teams is as important to create innovation and productivity. ]]></answer>

    <content><![CDATA[ When employees are unwell and supposed to be on medical leave, they are still working and coming into the office. This risks the potential spreading of viruses to others (and some of us have young children who are susceptible to the virus if we fall sick), and also means that the employee is unable to rest and recover.

This arises because there is an unspoken pressure / fear of being marked down by bosses while on MC.  Can the bank encourage a better working culture by supporting employees in their medical appointment / leave needs via a top-down approach? ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ I have many colleagues who are working mothers. I have seen how it’s a daily challenge for them to leave on time to pick up their kids up before 7pm. It is also not easy to find trusted childcare within a reasonable proximity.

Will DBS consider incorporating a childcare centre within the premises (the same way OCBC recently did)? This will go a long way in branding DBS as a family-friendly company and really incorporate work-life integration. I also believe this will build strong employee loyalty as we will be able to fully integrate our work commitments and family life.

As a working father, I will also appreciate having the peace of mind with a work place childcare centre and this does translate into more efficiency and better focus at work. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ I joined DBS Hong Kong a few years ago and opened a consolidation statement account as my Staff Account. After one year, some of CBG staff visited our office and promoted a Treasures Account. They claimed that as a staff privilege, no minimum deposit requirement is needed (when the usual average monthly deposit requirement is HKD 1M).

However, I abruptly received a letter in early November informing me that my DBS Staff Account has been downgraded as it didn’t meet the minimum deposit requirement. I called my RM and told her my feelings. She claimed that there is no way to help us upgrade as the change of policy was raised by top management – with the exception of SVPs, all DBS staff who do not meet the minimum deposit requirement will have their Staff Accounts downgraded.  I'm very disappointed with this policy change, which implies a strong class concept among staff.  While I haven't reaped any special benefits from the Treasures Account, the change has certainly made me lose my sense of belonging.  I apologise for taking up your time but I thought I should share this sentiment from the ground. ]]></content>

    <answer><![CDATA[ In my message to all of you in July, I outlined our performance management philosophy on eliminating pre-targeted distribution across ratings. Rather than “stack ranking employees by specific rank”, I would like to highlight once again that performance is measured on an absolute basis against the individual employee’s targets / goals. It takes into consideration a balanced scorecard approach, which includes customer, risk and control elements beyond revenue. From a broader organisation perspective, there will be a test of reasonableness across the performance rating distribution.

Having said that, bonuses should not be seen as an entitlement but rather it is granted for performing or achieving above one’s goals, regardless of rank. It is not a guaranteed payment and not everyone will receive a bonus. ]]></answer>

If you feel that pursuing a degree is the right thing for yourself, go for it! Depending on the role you are in now or roles you may be interested in the future, a degree in banking and management may provide you with a base of knowledge to build on. However, nothing beats having the actual experience and exposure of performing a specific role. Do weigh the pros and cons and decide for yourself what doors it can possibly open for you in your career.

If you believe your supervisor is making it difficult for you to pursue and further your education, please talk to your Business HR partner ]]></answer>

It is not that there is a dearth of talent within the organisation, but it is definitely true that we are not training our staff enough to move to the next level. Even horizontal movements within various departments are very rare. While new departments are opening up, people within the organisation are given very few opportunities. While we are all very excited with the way the bank is moving forward, what it holds for us individually in terms of growth is unclear. If people from within the organisation can be trained and involved in various functions, it could open up a whole new world of opportunities for people who want to be with DBS for the long haul. ]]></content>

    <answer><![CDATA[ Our internal mobility numbers have been trending upwards over the years. I checked the data for India and find that this is consistent, about 30% of vacancies have been filled internally in 2016. With the expansion of any business, we need to hire externally to be able to fill or back-fill those roles. 

In the recent case of hiring for DAH2 in India, you have to understand that it is a complete start-up situation and the flow between the bank and DAH2 is not expected to be significant as the skillsets are all very different, however this is something we will work on. 

In the meantime, you should continue to take responsibility for your own career. Reach out to areas where you think there are opportunities for you to develop and grow that will get you to the next level. ]]></answer>

    <content><![CDATA[ This year, there was an emphasis on internal mobility and we heard you being a strong advocate of this, in particular, telling the organisation 'I encourage you to experience different areas of banking in your careers'.

Unfortunately with the traditional thinking of our HR organisation and hiring managers, this is impossible. They don't trust the power of past experience, education and learning; but would only consider moves within the same domain and expect applicants to be a 99% match to the super-detailed job descriptions. Maybe hiring managers think it is a burden on their KPIs as they need to spend time to interview candidates and give them necessary training before they reach 100% of their expected performance.

Another criticism on internal mobility - we are a regional organisation with a growing footprint in Asia. But I don't see internal mobility happening between countries, except for some senior managers in the last couple of years.  This is especially so for roles in Hong Kong – they are managed by a separate HR team, who don’t update the status of applications on the online portal. Applications that came in four to five months ago remain with the status ‘resume acknowledged’. No one can tell who acknowledged it and what would happen next, if a candidate was not selected, what was the reason behind it. ]]></content>

    <answer><![CDATA[ We have made reasonably good progress in Internal Mobility, with about 30% of all our vacancies filled internally. And increasingly, our people are willing to take a shot on people without appropriate experiences, obviously more visible at senior levels, less at junior levels. Nevertheless, this is something that we will continue to push and encouraging people to hire internally first, because of many obvious advantages. I have also asked HR to tighten the Internal Mobility process, including updating the portal in a timely manner. 

On your point of cross-border mobility, we had 88 cross-border moves last year. Cross-border mobility tends to be a one-on-one arrangement, and you try and make the economics work on a one-on-one basis. While we encourage people to apply, we are also cognisant of the fact that sometimes it is not that easy. Apart from everything else, they are expensive. At junior levels, a lot of people choose not to move because it is hard to make the economics work. ]]></answer>

1. Learning &amp; Development
Here are some facts about DBS.  To connect the dots, why don't we build an app which can link all these facts for staff to put in their committed hours and other project managers to put in their assignments / projects?

a. DBS is a universal bank
b. We are in digital era and DBS embraces digital
c. Experience is the most effective way to learn
d. There are projects / assignments in DBS which lack resources
e. There is capacity elsewhere in the bank which can be optimised.
f. Managers are actually willing to develop and give more exposure to their team members.

2. DBS Souvenir

I am a loyal and happy employee who is really proud to use DBS-branded items e.g. tumblers, pens, umbrellas, etc. I guess I'm not the only one and I think DBS can sell these to employees so that we can give it to our family or colleagues. This can be useful for branding and marketing too." commentnumber="3" tags="HR, GSMC" answer="Thanks for the suggestion, we have been thinking of the same thing. In fact, we will also be launching the DBS Xplore Programme, where staff can take up short-term projects from other departments through an online platform.

GSMC is exploring this idea and they should be able to come up with something in the course of this year. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ When the cost of a digital customer was shared during the World’s Best Digital Bank Award announcement, I found that number very meaningful because it helps to entrench the importance and significance of everyone rallying around the priority of embracing digital. So why not calculate the cost of a digital employee as well? To be honest, how do we move towards digitisation of a customer journey without concurrently doing the same for the employee journey, especially since we are dependent on employees? I feel equal weightage needs to be placed on both efforts and that should include metrics and measurements to count the cost of a digital employee. This would help us know if the so-called future of work tools and infrastructure we have are truly helping employees to become not just digital-savvy, but really getting work done faster and easier. 

Most importantly, how do we expect to continually embed ourselves in the customer journey, put ourselves in their shoes, reimagine and shape banking, when we are not in that environment of a digital journey ourselves? When we know how to do things better, we will be in a better position to envision this for customers. This will also help minimise dissonance between perceived vs actual reality. The smaller the dissonance, the less the conflict within an employee, then the cause and purpose of making banking joyful will become truly a way of life for employees.  When we start measuring the big picture, then we can at least have a benchmark and keep hacking away till we get things right.  Would be great if digital value and P&amp;L includes customers as well as employees. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ I am from POSB Yishun North Centre. We understand that many branches are revising their banking hours to close early on weekdays and weekends. However, our branch is still maintaining the same operating hours which are from 8.30am to 8.30pm on weekdays and 8.30am to 3.00pm on Saturdays and Sundays.  As a result of these changes, there are more customers coming to our branch as we are one of the only four branches in Singapore that open on Sundays and for night banking till 8.30pm on weekdays. 

Consequently, our branch staff are always overworked and get home late.  I hope that our banking hours can be standardised with other DBS and POSB branches. Alternatively, I hope that some increment can be given to our staff allowance to compensate for the hectic working hours.  I hope you will hear our feedback. Your understanding and consideration in this matter is much appreciated. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ I am taking care of the India mortgage business. The overall business shaped up quite well and in less than two years, we are heading towards breakeven. But I always felt that we could have done far better. There are lots of areas where we need to improve as a bank to ensure faster growth.

1. Any changes to process, products and technology takes an abnormally long time. Maybe too many people are involved and there is not enough empowerment.

2. Launching a new product is a nightmare (sorry for using this word). There has to be a core team who should meet weekly and take it forward.  Participation of at least one member from the regional team should be mandatory to study the market with local support and give his / her expert views to the regional team as most of the time, product design happens without local input in absence of local market expertise. This leads to adverse selection of customers as well as the need to spend lots of time modifying the product with great difficulty.

3. While your vision of ‘No Ops’ is quite encouraging, our basic rules and regulations prevents us from implementing that. Technology and outsourcing are the keys which can make this happen, but unfortunately, the cost of technology for us is way too high to even think about. If we look at local technology solutions, it will give us the edge of getting things done quicker and cheaper. For example, we spent almost INR 12 Crs for a LOS &amp; LMS for mortgage in India even before starting the business and we are still spending on that to localise it. A local LOS would have done this in just one third of that price with all upgrades.

4. ‘Outsourcing’ - the way to go to achieve low cost and high productivity. We avoid it not because we don’t want to do it, but because of the process which takes about six months, if I am lucky enough. That too, is a full day job. Either we have a simple process-based business heads recommendation as we are responsible for our numbers and risk anyway, or there can be a specialised team who will get this done for the business based on demand and timeline.

5. Basic banking facilities - we need to understand what is important for customers and prioritise spending on that. For example, customers don’t get SMS if there is a credit in the account which is a basic requirement for any customer. There are lots of other basic banking facilities like this which is missing in our way of banking, though we have started working on those now. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ Just want to bring up my suggestion that our bank should align our TravellerShield promotion across all platforms. This is because there have been complaints that we are cheating customers when they buy TravellerShield over the counter from branches as they get a lower discount rate as compared to when they purchase online when the coverage is actually the same. Staff at branches also need to sell General Insurance as part of our KPI so we will definitely push for sales over the counter rather than getting customers to purchase online.  But we are losing sales to our online platform because of the high discount rate offered. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ It was my pleasure to chat with you during our branch Grand Opening at Raffles Medical Holland Village. I understand that this is not within my job scope as an RM, but I would like to urgently highlight the collaboration issue between Hoshino Coffee (DNH CO JP) and DBS.

Hoshino Coffee’s General Manager Mr Raymond Goh is a good friend of mine. Up till today, there has been no response from the DBS Marketing team to Raymond about whether DBS is keen to collaborate with them on DBS Cards promotion etc. Months ago, an email was sent by my West Region Banassurance Manager, Dominic Koh to DBS Marketing. Please kindly contact Mr Sakai Kengo, Asia Pacific Manager from DNH CO JP at (sakai@dnh.co.jp) or Mr Raymond Goh, GM of Hoshino Coffee (mobile: 98564907) as they have already prioritised our bank over the ready offer made by OCBC and they have been waiting for DBS’ reply.
I would really want to email this to you but the hierarchical system in DBS doesn't allow me to do so as I have to go through my Branch Business Manager and many levels of authority to inform you. Looking forward to hear from you! ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ There is currently a service centre at DBS Arcade.  There were a lot of ATMs previously, but since they closed the POSB branch and transferred the ATMs to a smaller unit near the service centre, there has been a lot of complaints.  There are two ATMs, a cheque deposit machine (CDM), an AXS machine, and two Cash Acceptance Machines which serve as ‘recyclers’, i.e. customers will only be able to withdraw cash if someone else deposits cash, all in a very tight space.  There is a non-stop queue of people trying to withdraw money to change with the money-changers.  As a result of this, the ATMs and CDMs naturally run out of cash very quickly and they are out of service most of the time. The queue is so long that it extends from the tiny lobby past the service centre entrance, blocking the entrance and other shops.

Customers get very upset and come in to the service centre to scream at staff.  As much as the service centre staff are patient and understanding, it gets really trying with the increasing number of angry customers.  As I understand that the bank is moving towards cashless payments, I suggest that we work out a way with the money-changers for customers to buy currencies using Paylah, PayWave or Apple Pay.  There must be a smarter way to handle these cash-hungry customers and money-changers.  I am positive that the money changers will want to adopt a better method to increase their sales and reduce their cash on-hand.  It’s up to us to set the change in motion. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ I'm asking this on a customer’s behalf.  She deposits cheques from other issuers regularly into her DBS account, sometimes a few cheques at a time and they may be of the same amount. Her feedback is for the cheque number of the cleared cheques to be reflected on our customer statements. She mentioned that other banks are already doing so - it will be easier for her to track which are the cheques that have been cleared because it’s difficult for her to get to the issuer every time. ]]></content>

In light of the ever-increasing interdependence between countries / corporates in the region, in what ways do you think can DBS enhance our internal Asian Connectivity to capture these cross-border opportunities? How can we avoid working in silos and be locally-focused, yet adopt a global / regional perspective and be able to execute with our bank's full capability across countries? ]]></content>

We have yet to introduce the concept of partnership segment where a single customer can be sourced by multiple business groups and such groups can simultaneously be given shadow credit for sourcing that client. By introducing the partnership concept, we can take advantage of business synergies leading to better cross-sell and help generate more profits for the bank. A suggestion to be considered. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ SME Banking, especially the asset business, requires more tailor-made ‘judgmental’ solutions.  Banks typically provide equal weightage to both financial and non-financial parameters.  We have a local parameterised programme which is more readymade in nature and does not recognise the differing financial profiles of enterprises by industry, market, product. This can become a hurdle to our business growth. I request your view to address this challenge. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ Customers often express their frustration that the bank is very inefficient in our processes, because there are a lot of matters we can't handle online in IBG. One example is audit confirmations. Banks in the US are using platforms such as www.confirmation.com which allow customers to receive their confirmations in 30 minutes. That's just one example. So many issues require original paperwork and high courier costs. Why is DBS so slow to digitise in these areas despite being the world's Best Digital Bank? ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ At the beginning or end of each month, Customer Service Officers (CSOs) receive plenty of requests for term loan statements. We were informed that these statements are sent to customers on a yearly basis. However, for many of our corporate customers who need to do accounting, it makes no sense to wait a year to be able to account for their interest and principal repayment amount.  Currently, CSOs have to use Finacle to generate the statements on ad-hoc basis. Could there be a way for this to be incorporated in IDEAL for customers to retrieve their statements? ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ I would like to highlight an issue related to 'Digi Bank' which I am facing. When I tried to do biometrics authentication, the authentication fails every time. As per the suggestion from customer support, I have visited Aadhaar centre to update the biometrics but the authentication still fails even after multiple attempts.  I have observed the same issue with some of my colleagues in my previous company and we couldn't open a Digi Bank savings account even though we are eager to use DBS Digi Bank app.

I know this is a rare issue. But this will definitely impact the business. For example, if any high-value customer faces this issue and he couldn't open the account, we may lose the customer. When I checked with our customer support, they told me that fingerprint authentication is the only option to open a Digi Bank savings account. But I would suggest having some workaround for those who are facing such issues so that we can accommodate every customer.  Hope we can address this for a better banking experience. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ I was wondering about the PIP framework and its efficacy.  To begin with, what is its purpose?  One would assume it is to prevent insider trading, to allow DBS to be (and just as, if not more importantly, be viewed) as being above board and to protect against conflicts of interest (perceived or actual).  What are the procedures it requires?  Firstly, one has to declare online, wait for approval, which is sent to you and your superior, after which you may trade if you received approval.  My complaints with the system are two-fold.

- it is a supremely tedious process. The trouble required (steps listed above) goes over and above what is necessary, relative to its aim. It seems to me that restrictive policies such as this are counter-productive; they would usually result in people trading via a proxy, circumventing the policy's intended purpose to begin with.

- investment strategy is an intrinsically personal thing. I do not see why my superior has to be copied and I believe this is an affront to my privacy. Couldn't an unrelated and neutral third party play the role?

The situation is aggravated when you have a buy or sell price that is not at spot - to execute an order, you will have to constantly apply for approval, embarrassingly flooding your superior's mailbox in the process, until the market moves in your favour and your trade is executed. Again, this second point compounds the issues raised previously - a policy as restrictive as this is made worse with social issues, ultimately being counter-productive and doing more damage than benefit. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ Due to the Strategic Cost Management Printer Cost Management initiative, the bank no longer allows photocopier purchases. The default print cost ratio is set at 50%-50%, and this can be adjusted accordingly upon the agreement between the two departments. This arrangement tends to lead to some disagreements among the departments.

Can this be done like some other banks which install card readers on photocopiers? This will lead to better tracking of usage to determine the individual department’s printing costs, sharing of photocopiers between all parties without arguments, and better info security. Apart from that, some people forget to take the printouts after printing, leading to wastage. With the card reader, the photocopier will only print when a staff pass is tapped. ]]></content>

Secondly, do you think it is a good idea to create ‘DBS Bank Journeys’ around each of these 12 topics? The bank can thus dip into the Intellectual Property of employees and get a list of well-structured and holistic action items to exploit the opportunities offered. ]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[ DBS was my first full time employer after graduation.  I worked here for about eight years and left for the forest and I am now back after a 10-year hiatus.  I am very proud to see the massive changes and it is very obvious that the bank has invested a lot of resources on strategies / technology / training etc. to ensure that DBS and our staff can stay relevant and meet the demands of the changing landscape. However, the ‘heart-ware’ of the people, especially those in a position of influence, is lagging behind. The young workforce looks up to the leaders they interact with daily to mirror the behaviours / get inspired etc. and I am not confident if they are receiving the right signals. More resources should be invested to cultivate and internalise a stronger PRIDE!, personal leadership. We need to understand why we need to do certain things. Not just do things for our own interest or just because someone said, it has to make sense. The only resource in Singapore is her people. We need to do our part at home / in school and at work to plant and cultivate the seeds of personal leadership. ]]></content>
