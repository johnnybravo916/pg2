  <blog id="1" date="2017 Q1" content="I believe that the crowding of the lift lobby at DBS Asia Hub (DAH) has been highlighted many times before. Normally, the lifts are programmed such that once the button has been pressed, one lift will respond while the other lifts will be on standby if not occupied. However, during morning peak hours, we all know that one lift at a time is not enough. Thus, the default programming above is not effective, especially when the lifts on standby are usually at higher levels. People would usually see a full lift go up and wait for an empty one to come down from level nine. Will it be possible for the default standby level for all lifts to be at level one, i.e. all vacant lifts will automatically go back to level one and have their doors open on standby to cater to the morning crowd? The opposite can be applied in the evening." commentnumber="3" tags="CRESA"/>

  <blog id="3" date="2017 Q1" content="In the beginning, table decals were a clever way to drum up publicity for internal activities, competitions and policies. The situation seems to have gotten unwieldy now as there are stickers at social hub benches and tables at The Exchange in every direction. The wooden tables are now showing signs of wear when the decals are removed, as the varnish is affected by the adhesive. Is there a specific owner policing what stickers go up, how they are positioned and ensure furniture is touched up if there is damage?" commentnumber="3" tags="CRESA"/>
  <blog id="4" date="2017 Q1" content="It is nice to have an exclusive kitchen for the staff on level 13.  However, I would like to suggest that people stop 'chope-ing the seats with a tissue pack'. I reserve my opinion on this Singapore culture that is otherwise practised in a food court, but the whole point of having our own canteen is for us to have a quick and easy lunch. The queues are typically long and people need at least 10 minutes to complete their order, that is enough time for many people to finish their meal. Having the table reserved but not used while waiting defeats the purpose of having a staff canteen. It reduces the turnover tremendously and it is not good manners to fellow colleagues when half of the seats are empty but 'reserved'." commentnumber="3" tags="CRESA"/>
  <blog id="5" date="2017 Q1" content="I think we should have a multi-faith meditation or prayer room in each of our buildings, no matter where they are (India, Singapore, Indonesia). This will be a good place for our Muslim and Christian friends to pray, but also for everyone to have a quiet area where they can reflect if the need arises. It will be good for cohesion - meant for everyone. When our Indonesian colleagues come over, it is also difficult for them to find a place to pray in our Singapore buildings." commentnumber="3" tags="CRESA"/>
  <blog id="6" date="2017 Q1" content="I want to share my experience in my previous company in the Philippines where the huddle rooms are transformed into themed rooms decorated with the appropriate wallpaper and furniture / accessories e.g. Rejuvenation Room (spa with a massage chair), Library (with books for sharing and a lazy boy), Boracay (beach wallpaper and beach chairs), Tennis Room (big soft tennis ball as a chair and a customised big shuttle cock lighting), Dance Room (with three walls of mirrors), Music Room (with musical equipment like a band), Forest Room (wallpaper of trees), Car Room (with racing car sets and TV, set up like an arcade), etc. We also had foosball tables in every pantry, a boxing room and a mini gym where exercise classes are conducted (similar to our 13F classes). It was so cool that it was featured in one of the local magazines and the company is regarded as one of the best employers in the country. 

  The rooms can be used through a booking system so that staff have the chance to use different themes. I think DBS employees will love it. For a start, aside from the foosball tables, we can transform one focus room or meeting room per floor or per department, into a themed room. Each floor / department can nominate the theme they want to install (within an approved budget (?), can top up(?)) and engage employees in the process. I think this will transform the view of going to meetings into a more exciting activity. We can be featured by office interior design magazines which will in turn attract talent to join our company (provided we have vacancies because I believe it's hard for people to leave such a cool company!). I also think that it will help us make working in DBS even more Joyful. It is like work-life balance is already brought into the office.

  PS: I have been with DBS for four years now, two years and eight months as an external contractor, left to join another bank but came back after two months, one year and four months as a perm staff. Working with DBS makes me feel at home which is why I came back. And I hope to decorate my 'home' into a more joyful place. I'm thankful for this experience and I'm proud to be part of a great company." commentnumber="3" tags="CRESA"/>
  <blog id="7" date="2017 Q1" content="A few weeks ago, I had to do an early tech refresh as my Lenovo laptop's wireless card was faulty and was not longer under warranty. This inconvenienced me because I could not move from one location to another without having to restart my machine to get connected to the office network. Sometimes I had to restart my machine several times. I ordered the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, which was recently made available. My new machine was delivered in October and the set-up was only done some three weeks later in November.

  I tried time and again to request for the machine delivery and the set-up to coincide with each other, but I was informed that this was not possible as there were insufficient engineers to do the set-up. It did not make any sense for me to receive a new machine, only to have the new machine set-up three weeks later. In addition, I was also informed that I had to request for data transfer to be done, for which there would be additional charges. I wonder if the product bundle on EPS for tech refresh should include data transfer services (as opposed to that of request for new machines)?  How might we improve the employee experience for the staff who needs to get a new machine to do his / her job effectively?" commentnumber="3" tags="T&amp;O"/>

  <blog id="9" date="2017 Q1" content="Staff at DBS Asia Hub 2 (DAH2) don't seem to be getting direct email messages from you, like the one you sent for the ANZ acquisition. In addition, O365 has not yet been rolled out at DAH2 and we cannot see your Yammer updates. It would be great if all staff can get O365 which would also help in addressing Outlook PST issues." commentnumber="3" tags="T&amp;O"/>
  <blog id="10" date="2017 Q1" content="Thanks for giving us the opportunity to share with you.
  This is regarding the Internet Banking and Mobile Banking Mainframe as well as deployment for different systems on Saturdays and Sundays.  We have noticed in the past two years that every release is deployed over the weekend. Could you please change it to working days?  Advantages of shifting it to working days:

  - All relevant parties (Technical, Management for approvals), besides just the planned support team will be available during deployment.  So if any issues arise, the resolution and approvals will be quick.

  - Minimal work required to do support roster or we can avoid preparation of support roster altogether

  - As I understand, weekends are no different from working days and even more business happens.

  - Team DBS can spend quality time with family and give more effort towards the DBS projects.

  - This way, we can improve the ‘relationship-led’ in our PRIDE! values." commentnumber="3" tags="T&amp;O"/>
  <blog id="11" date="2017 Q1" content="You have announced at the last DBS OPEN that GOOD access is now available to all staff. I think this is a great idea, especially for people like us who are always on the move and who had to stay back in office to clear emails. With O365, it will improve our efficiency tremendously. Thumbs up!

  However, how can we address mobile data usage while using GOOD? 1Bankroam Wi-Fi within the office compound has been disabled with the reason that corporate lines are bundled with free data plans. We all know that corporate lines do not apply to AVPs and below. By having GOOD, usage within the office compound or out on the move may still not seem to be very ideal." commentnumber="3" tags="T&amp;O"/>
  <blog id="12" date="2017 Q1" content="The 1bankroam staff WI-FI has been abruptly terminated this September. It was stated in the Collaborative User Services intranet site that Starhub corporate lines have free data plans (I assume this is staff CIS plans) but I've checked with Starhub and there are no such free data plans.  This is the relevant section from the site.

'As current Starhub corporate lines are bundled with free data plans, with effect from 16 September 2016, 1bankroam Wi-Fi service will be discontinued.'

Can the 1bankroam WI-FI be restored?  For staff using the Good Work app on personal smartphones, it is consuming a large amount of data at our own expense.  Please consider bringing 1bankroam back to DBS premises.

  <blog id="13" date="2017 Q1" content="It is sad that 1bankroam WI-FI is no longer available for staff.  We should keep in mind that not all staff have the company mobile data plan." commentnumber="3" tags="T&amp;O"/>
  <blog id="14" date="2017 Q1" content="Lately, there has been a surge of emails asking staff to download apps such as DBS E-Learning, CBO Rewards, Good Work, Good Access, to name a few.  It's good that the bank is targeting Digital Banking. It should focus on customers instead of staff.  A handphone is a personal item and there is limited data, depending on the data plan. Free Wi-Fi has been disabled and who will pay if data usage is exceeded?  With all these apps, will work-life balance be affected?" commentnumber="3" tags="T&amp;O"/>
  <blog id="15" date="2017 Q1" content="Now that ‘Good’ is made available to all permanent staff, can we have Wi-Fi back? Not all permanent staff have corporate lines." commentnumber="3" tags="T&amp;O"/>
