  <blog id="1" date="2017 Q1" content="I believe that the crowding of the lift lobby at DBS Asia Hub (DAH) has been highlighted many times before. Normally, the lifts are programmed such that once the button has been pressed, one lift will respond while the other lifts will be on standby if not occupied. However, during morning peak hours, we all know that one lift at a time is not enough. Thus, the default programming above is not effective, especially when the lifts on standby are usually at higher levels. People would usually see a full lift go up and wait for an empty one to come down from level nine. Will it be possible for the default standby level for all lifts to be at level one, i.e. all vacant lifts will automatically go back to level one and have their doors open on standby to cater to the morning crowd? The opposite can be applied in the evening." commentnumber="3" tags="Technology &amp; Operations"/>

  <blog id="3" date="2017 Q1" content="In the beginning, table decals were a clever way to drum up publicity for internal activities, competitions and policies. The situation seems to have gotten unwieldy now as there are stickers at social hub benches and tables at The Exchange in every direction. The wooden tables are now showing signs of wear when the decals are removed, as the varnish is affected by the adhesive. Is there a specific owner policing what stickers go up, how they are positioned and ensure furniture is touched up if there is damage?" commentnumber="3" tags="Consumer Banking"/>
  <blog id="4" date="2017 Q1" content="It is nice to have an exclusive kitchen for the staff on level 13.  However, I would like to suggest that people stop 'chope-ing the seats with a tissue pack'. I reserve my opinion on this Singapore culture that is otherwise practised in a food court, but the whole point of having our own canteen is for us to have a quick and easy lunch. The queues are typically long and people need at least 10 minutes to complete their order, that is enough time for many people to finish their meal. Having the table reserved but not used while waiting defeats the purpose of having a staff canteen. It reduces the turnover tremendously and it is not good manners to fellow colleagues when half of the seats are empty but 'reserved'." commentnumber="3" tags="Group Research"/>
  <blog id="5" date="2017 Q1" content="I think we should have a multi-faith meditation or prayer room in each of our buildings, no matter where they are (India, Singapore, Indonesia). This will be a good place for our Muslim and Christian friends to pray, but also for everyone to have a quiet area where they can reflect if the need arises. It will be good for cohesion - meant for everyone. When our Indonesian colleagues come over, it is also difficult for them to find a place to pray in our Singapore buildings." commentnumber="3" tags="Others"/>
